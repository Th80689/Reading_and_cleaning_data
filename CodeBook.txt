Input
###################
Folder \UCI HAR Dataset\
features.txt: contains names of observation variables
activity_labels.txt: contains activity codes (numeric) and activity descriptions (activityname)

Subfolder \UCI HAR Dataset\test\
Generally: contains observations from a test set of the subjects
subject_test.txt: contains a list of subject-id's - for each entry in X_test.txt there is a corresponding subject id the measures are taken from
X_test.txt: contains observations for 561 variables
y_test.txt: contains a list of activity-id's -  - for each entry in X_test.txt there is a corresponding activity id the measures are taken from

Subfolder \UCI HAR Dataset\train\
Generally: contains observations from a training set of the subjects
subject_train.txt: contains a list of subject-id's - for each entry in X_test.txt there is a corresponding subject id the measures are taken from
X_train.txt: contains observations for 561 variables
y_train.txt: contains a list of activity-id's -  - for each entry in X_test.txt there is a corresponding activity id the measures are taken from

The file "tidy_data_set,txt" contains following variables:

"subjectid": derived from files "subject_test.txt" and "subject_train.txt"
"activityname": derived from file "activity_labels.txt", second column activity description
## all following columns contain the average of all observations from corresponding columns in "X_test.txt" and "X_train.txt" for each unique pair of "subjectid" and "activityname":
